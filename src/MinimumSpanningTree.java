/**
 * What is Spanning Tree?
 * In an undirected and connected graph G = (V, E), a spanning tree is a subgraph that is a tree which includes
 * all of the vertices of G, with minimum possible number of edges.
 *
 * A graph may have several spanning trees.
 *
 * The cost of the spanning tree is the sum of the weights of all the edges in the tree.
 *
 * What is a Minimum Spanning Tree?
 *
 * A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted
 * undirected graph that connects all the vertices together without any cycles and will minimum possible total edge weight.
 *
 * That is, it is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible.
 * Number of edges in MST = V - 1 (V = no of vertices in Graph)

 *
 * Algorithms for find the Minimum Spanning Tree:
 *
 * 1) Kruskal's Algorithm
 * 2) Prim's Algorithm
 *
 * Applications:
 *
 * Minimum spanning trees have direct applications in the design of networks including computer networks,
 * telecommunications networks, transportation networks, water supply networks and electrical grids.
 *
 * Also used in
 *
 * 1) Approximating Travelling Salesman problem
 * 2) Approximating multi-terminal minimum cut problem
 * 3) Approximating minimum-cost weighted perfect Cluster Analysis
 * 4) Handwriting recognition
 * 5) Image Segmentation
 * 6) Circuit Design
